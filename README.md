# Pokédex Recreation

https://pokedex-silk-gamma.vercel.app/

This project is a recreation of a Pokédex as a working web app. You can search for pokémon by name as well as filter by type, generation, and ability.

This project was created with the following tech stack:

- React
- Vite
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

## How to Use

> Note: Mobile support for this web-app is limited and may not have proper functionality.

Here is what the main screen will look like when you first load the page:

You may start searching for pokémon immediately by clicking the search-bar to your right where it says _"Search for a pokémon"_. By default, you will be searching in the global pokédex, but to narrow your search results you have three filters:

- Types
- Generation
- Abilities

Clicking on each filter will display a pop-up menu that will allow you to select what criteria you want to search by. Now, only pokémon that match the selected criteria will show up in the search results.

To change what units the pokémon height and weight will be displayed with, you may click on the toggles labelled with **LB** and **KG** to switch between Imperial and Metric measurement.

At any time, you may click the _Clear Filters_ button to reset all filters to default.
